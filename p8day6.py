# 1. What are Python Modules?
# It is simply a file that contains Python code.
# It acts like a toolbox containing tools (such as functions, classes, variables, etc.) that you can reuse in your program.
# This approach is also called code refactoring.

#! 2. The Indian Kitchen Analogy for Python Modules.
# Think of a module like a spice box (masala dabba) in an Indian kitchen.

#! 3. How to Use a Module?

#* 3.1 Let's start with in-built math module
import os
os.system('cls')
import math
# Using the sqrt() function from the math module
sqrtResult = math.sqrt(16)
print(sqrtResult)

# Using the fsum() function from the math module
sumResult = math.fsum({80,20})
print(sumResult)

# Using the sin() function from the math module
sinResult = math.sin(90)
print(sinResult)

# Using datetime time
import datetime
# Get the current date and time
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
print(current_time)

# Using os module
import os
# Get the current working directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print(current_directory)

# Using sys module
import sys
# Get the list of command-line arguments
arguments = sys.argv
print(arguments)
print("Python Version:", sys.version_info)
sys.exit(0)

#! 4. What is a Python Library?
 # A collection of modules that provide tools and functions to perform specific tasks, simplifying development and reducing code duplication.
 
 #! 5. Indian Railway System Analogy for Python Library.
 # Imagine the Indian railway system.
 # Each train station is like a module with specific functions. It serves a specific purpose and has its own set of functions (like boarding, ticketing, etc.)
 # The entire railway system, connecting all stations, is like a library.
 # Itâ€™s a collection of stations (modules) that work together to help you travel across the states/countries.
 #* Similarly, a Python library is a collection of modules that work together to help you perform a specific task.
 
 #! 6. Popular python libraries.
 #* 6.1 NumPy
 # - Library used for numerical computations.
 # - Provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions.
 
 #* 6.2 Pandas
 # - Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
 # - Provides data structures like DataFrames for handling tabular data.
 
 #* 6.3 Matplotlib
 # - Library used for creating visualizations like graphs and charts.
 # - Commonly used in data science to visualize data.
 
 #* 6.4 Requests
 # - Library used for making HTTP requests.
 # - Useful for interacting with web APIs and fetching data from the internet.
